        <h3>General Dentistry</h3>
        <p>General dentistry is focused on keeping your teeth and gums healthy regardless of age or past dental work. Most patients will be seen roughly twice a year for a cleaning and a comprehensive check-up. These check-ups will see if there are any areas of concern like possible cavities or crowns.</p>
